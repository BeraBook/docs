### 🧸 What’s a Limit Order, Anyway?

A **Limit Order** is like telling the market, “I’ll trade my BERA or HONEY, but only at my price or better. Take it or leave it!”

Here’s why limit orders are so cool:

🐾 **Price Control:** You decide the exact price to buy or sell. No surprises!

🐾 **Stay in Control:** If no one’s ready to trade at your price, your order sits patiently on the order book until it’s matched.

🐾 **MEV? Not Today, Satan!** Limit orders on Bera Book are **MEV-resistant**, meaning no sneaky frontrunners can mess with your exchange rate.
